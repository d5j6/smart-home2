# NodeMCU Documentation

At the moment the only up-to-date documentation maintained by the current NodeMCU team is in English and hosted at http://nodemcu.readthedocs.io/. It is part of the source code repository (`/docs` subfolder), kept in sync with the code and built & published automatically.

We encourage you to help transferring the outdated translations (see below) into the repository.

## Outdated And Sparse Documentation
The following translations are based on outdated documentation, use them with caution.

- Chinese, [中文](./nodemcu_api_cn)
- Russian, [русский](./nodemcu_api_ru)
- Spanish, [español](./nodemcu_api_es)
